# BadUSB Shenanigans: My Journey

Welcome to my journey into the wild world of BadUSB exploits! This repository is a mix of personal discoveries, tools, and scripts that I’ve explored while tinkering with USB devices and their potential for creative (and responsible!) use. If you’re here, chances are you’re looking to dive into the same mischief—ethically, of course.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**. Misuse of these tools or scripts is your own responsibility. Always get proper authorization before testing or deploying any of these techniques. Don’t be a jerk—security research should help people, not harm them!

## 🔍 What Is This About?

BadUSB is an exploit leveraging the firmware capabilities of USB devices to execute commands, inject malicious payloads, or manipulate systems. Inspired by the potential of devices like Rubber Ducky and other programmable USB tools, I set out to explore:

- Writing custom payloads.
- Bypassing basic security measures.
- Automating tasks and creating clever shortcuts.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1. **Payloads**
A collection of payload scripts written for different BadUSB platforms. You’ll find examples ranging from:

- **Pranks**: Fun (but harmless) scripts.
- **Automation**: Useful macros for repetitive tasks.
- **Pentesting**: Ethical hacking scripts for authorized testing.

### 2. **Tools & Configurations**
- Guides for setting up various BadUSB devices (e.g., Rubber Ducky, Flipper Zero).
- Pre-configured scripts and device settings.
- Tips for customizing payloads.

### 3. **Documentation**
- Walkthroughs and tutorials explaining how these payloads work.
- Best practices for safe testing and deployment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- A programmable USB device (e.g., Rubber Ducky, Flipper Zero, or Arduino-based devices).
- Basic knowledge of scripting (Bash, Powershell, or Python will come in handy).

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/znlv/badusb-shenanigans.git
   cd badusb-shenanigans
   ```
2. Flash your USB device with the necessary firmware (see the Tools & Configurations folder for guides).
3. Load a payload from the Payloads folder.

---

## ⚙️ Usage
1. Choose a payload script that fits your needs.
2. Customize it for your environment or target system.
3. Deploy responsibly! Run the script on authorized systems only.
